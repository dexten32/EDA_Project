# Hospital EDA – Heart Attack Risk Analysis

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hospital patient records to identify
clinical factors associated with heart attack likelihood. The focus is on understanding
relationships between medical indicators using structured data analysis and visualization.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized hospital patient records with clinical attributes commonly
used in cardiovascular risk assessment.

### Key variables analyzed:
- Blood Pressure
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- ECG Results
- Age
- Other supporting clinical indicators

---

## Analysis Workflow
The project follows a standard EDA pipeline:

1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory analysis of feature distributions
4. Correlation analysis between clinical variables
5. Visualization of trends and high-risk patient groups
